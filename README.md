# Build the boot image.
To build the boot sector, you'll need to first make
sure you have the following installed:
```
nasm
qemu (qemu-system-i386 in particular)
```

Now run the following command in your bash terminal:

``make run_boot``

qemu will now have booted the OS from the hard disk
successfully!
